# Fenerbahce CPU Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Fenerbahce CPU project! This group project focuses on implementing a CPU using the Verilog simulator. This repository contains the Verilog code for the Fenerbahce CPU, a PowerPoint presentation explaining the code, a document detailing the tools and methodologies used, and a video presentation providing an in-depth explanation of the PowerPoint slides.

## Contents

1. **Verilog Code** (*fbCPU_MONM_Grp.v*): The directory containing the Verilog code for the Fenerbahce CPU. This is the core of our project, where the CPU's functionality is implemented.

2. **PowerPoint Presentation** (*fbCPU_MONM_grp - PowerPoint*): The presentation slides explaining the code, architecture, and implementation details of the Fenerbahce CPU.

3. **Project Documentation** (*FB_CPU-Project_MONM-Group_.pdf*): A document file (e.g., Word or PDF) providing comprehensive information about the tools, methodologies, and design decisions made during the development of the Fenerbahce CPU.

4. **Video Presentation** (*/fbCPU_MONM_grp - Video*): A video presentation where the team explains the PowerPoint slides in detail, providing a visual walkthrough of the Fenerbahce CPU project.

## How to Use

### Verilog Code

The Verilog code can be simulated using a Verilog simulator *https://avionchip.com/virtualfpga/*
The code in `fbCPU_MONM_Grp.v`

### PowerPoint Presentation

The PowerPoint presentation in the `fbCPU_MONM_grp - PowerPoint` directory serves as a visual guide to understanding the Fenerbahce CPU project. Each slide explains different aspects of the project, from design choices to implementation details.

### Project Documentation

Refer to the documentation in the `FB_CPU-Project_MONM-Group_.pdf` directory for a detailed overview of the tools and methodologies used in the Fenerbahce CPU project. This document provides insights into the decision-making process and the rationale behind the design.

### Video Presentation

Watch the video presentation in the `fbCPU_MONM_grp - Video` directory to get a comprehensive walkthrough of the PowerPoint slides. The video offers a more dynamic explanation of the Fenerbahce CPU project, with the team elaborating on each key point.
